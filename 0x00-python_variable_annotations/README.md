# Python - Variable Annotations

> `annotation` - a text that describes/explains image or other text

In the context of python, Variable Annotation is a way of telling whoever is reading our code, what type(int, str, bool etc) a variable supposed to hold or the type a function receive as argument or the type it returns.

`dynamically typed` - In contrast to statically typed languages like C, Python is dynamically typed and what that means is - the type is determined at run time upon assignment of a value and a variable that hold say float can be change elsewhere to int. - `documentation`

`Note` - python does not enforce it annotation. However, python annotation can be enforced by third party tools/code like linters or code editors. - `validation`
