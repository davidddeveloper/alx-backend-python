# Python - Async
asyncronous code is a style of programming implemented across a wide range of programming languages that let's code run concurrently.


> `quick definition`: asyncio is a style of concurrent programming. asyncio uses cooperative multi-tasking rather than multi-threading, so it is not parallelism neither is it multi-threaded. Infact it is single threaded.

> `async/await` are python keywords that let's us define coroutines.

> `coroutines` is a function that can pause and cede (give up) control to event loop, so that other task that a ready to execute can then run
